            <h1>Ways to Check If Your PC Parts Are Compatible Before You Buy</h1>
            <p>Buying new PC parts? Building out a whole new gaming rig? Make sure your parts are compatible before hitting Pay!

            <p>When you're building a new PC or considering upgrading your hardware, the most important consideration is compatibility. Making sure all your hardware components work together can save you hours down the line, and make sure your shiny new bit of kit fits into your existing build.</p>

                <h3>1. PCPartPicker</h3>
              
                <p>Top of any PC hardware compatibility list is always PCPartPicker. It's the ultimate go-to for anyone building a new PC or considering a hardware upgrade. It's filled with a vast array of PC hardware, and you can use it to build out a whole configuration or to check if two parts work together.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="ways/1.png" class="wayspic">
                <br>
                <p>You can find motherboards, hard drives, CPUs, power supply units, and everything else you need on PCParkPicker, and its easy-to-use interface, Build Guides, and Completed Builds sections are great for newcomers or those that want some inspiration.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>2. Manufacturer Website</h3>
                <p>Unsurprisingly, the hardware manufacturers know a thing or two about compatibility. While PCPartPicker makes this process even easier, sometimes the hardware manufacturer's additional information and clarity is useful.</p>
            <p>Most manufacturers provide extensively detailed information on their hardware, including compatibility, updates, warranty information, and more. For example, if you head on over to the Intel site and search for a CPU, it'll tell you the exact chipset to use (which tells you which type of motherboard to buy), along with the supported amount and type of RAM.</p>

            <h3>3. Google Bard (Or Another Internet-Connected AI Chatbot)</h3>
            <p>The world's leading AI chatbot, ChatGPT, doesn't have direct internet access. Or rather, it did, but it has been switched off at the time of writing. But that's no problem because we can turn to Google's Bard AI chatbot instead to help check if our hardware is compatible.</p>
            <p>You can use Bard to help check PC hardware compatibility in two ways. First, you can straight-up ask Bard to create a custom PC build for you, making sure each part is compatible.</p>
